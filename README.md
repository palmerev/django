# Django apps
_Apps I worked on as a student at PDX Code Guild_

My capstone project at PDX Code Guild is [Intramusical](https://github.com/palmerev/django/tree/master/intra_musical_project), an application that generates ear-training exercises for musicians.

**NOTE**: Other Django applications I've built are in their own separate repositories, often prefixed with `django-`.
